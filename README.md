Flexible Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
=====================================

ggsea is a R package to do gene set enrichment analysis [1]. Main advantages:

 - Allows user defined functions.
   So you can use you favorite package for differential expression.
 - Calculates significance by sample permutation.
 - Parallelization using the foreach package.
 - Can calculate normalized enrichment scores (NES) and significance based on that.
 - Implements the weighted KS-like statistic.

The package is not yet on CRAN.
You can install from Github:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("NKI-CCB/ggsea")
```

Main documentation is on the `ggsea` function in the package:

``` r
help('ggsea', 'ggsea')
```
