\title{Calculate significance of gene set enrichments from permutations.}
\usage{
ggsea(x, y, gene.sets, sig.fun=ggsea_calc_sig)
}
\description{
Calculates significance like Subramanian et al.. Significance is calculated
separately for positive and ES scores. A normalized enrichment score (NES)
is calculated. The NES for all gene sets are combined to get more precision
with less permutations.
